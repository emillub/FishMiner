# FishMiner

**FishMiner** is a game development project conducted as part of the *TDT4240 Software Architecture* course at NTNU. The goal of this project is to develop a functional multiplayer game for Android, designed using software architecture principles covered in the course. The game includes multiplayer support, online components, and server-based functionality. The architecture prioritizes **modifiability** as the primary quality attribute and **usability** and **performance** as the secondary.

FishMiner is a 2D arcade-style fishing game where players control a hook to catch fish, earn points, and progress through increasingly difficult levels. As players advance, they can unlock and purchase upgrades to improve their gear, such as stronger reels, faster sinkers, and more precise hooks. The game features a level-based structure, smooth real-time gameplay, and an online leaderboard where players can compete for high scores.

# LibGDX
A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and a main class extending `Game` that sets the first screen.

## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3; was called 'desktop' in older docs.
- `android`: Android mobile platform. Needs Android SDK.
- `html`: Web platform using GWT and WebGL. Supports only Java projects.

## Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `android:lint`: performs Android project validation.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `html:dist`: compiles GWT sources. The compiled application can be found at `html/build/dist`: you can use any HTTP server to deploy it.
- `html:superDev`: compiles GWT sources and runs the application in SuperDev mode. It will be available at [localhost:8080/html](http://localhost:8080/html). Use only during development.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/libs`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.
